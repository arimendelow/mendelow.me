I rebuilt this site because the old setup looked polished but made writing feel heavy. Every post felt like a mini design project, and that friction made shipping less frequent.

This version is intentionally small: one homepage, one about page, and straightforward post pages. The homepage is the blog itself, so there is no extra click before you start reading.

I also wanted the layout to stay close to plain text. No cards, no hero blocks, and no visual noise competing with the writing. Just title, date, reading time, and a short description.

## What Changed

- Inter replaced the previous type setup.
- The page width was tightened to keep line length readable.
- Navigation is now just my name and an About link.
- Post metadata includes reading time calculated from word count.

## What Comes Next

Next I want to publish short build notes more often, then expand into longer posts once the writing rhythm is steady. The goal is consistency over perfection.
